Let's create a minimalist but sleek one-page UI for an app that supports public speech practice sessions. We name the app "Oratio".

The app should have two main components: a speech type selector, a topic generator and a timer:

1. Speech type selector
    - Allow the user to choose between impromptu, prepared, or evaluative speech.
    - Topic generation is only meant for impromptu speeches, so only allow the user to navigate there if the impromptu speech option is selected
2. The topic generator:
    - Should allow the user to choose a theme, and the actual topics that are generated should be based around that theme.
    - Each time "generate topics" is pressed, it should allow the user to select one of five topics
3. The timer:
    - It should be some sort of input menu that provides the following default speech options:
        - Impromptu: 2.5 minutes
        - Prepared: 7 minutes
        - Evaluative: 2.5 minutes
    - Once a speech has been started, colours should guide the speaker in how much time they have left. Colours (at times remaining): initial is white -> 1 minute left (green) -> 30 seconds left (orange) -> 0, time's up (red into finish animation with a positive message, e.g., "Well done!")). Each of the 3 timestamps above should be when a gentle animation is shown to signify to the speaker how much time they have left.
    - A timer ticking down might cause nervousness, so let's add a toggle next to the play and restart buttons to turn that off. When it is off, there should be a quick animation for e.g., "1 minute remaining" once the green colour is shown.
- Overall UI requirements:
    - The speech selection should be placed above the timer, with a button for opening the the topic generator menu shown when impromptu speech mode is selected. These should both disappear once a public speech has been "started".
    - During a speech, only the topic and the timer should be visible, with gentle colour animations to help the speaker with their timing
    - Scrolling should not be necessary on a laptop screen. It should be contained within a clean full page SPA, with a button to make it full screen.
    - It should be dark mode by default
    - Make the animations across the whole app fancy so that it feels like a smooth UI and a polished app

It should be noted that this app must primarily support attendees and speakers in focusing better on the speech, it should be a background tool that is non-distracting as possible.
